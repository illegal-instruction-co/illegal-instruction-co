I’m M. Berkay Karataş, a software developer and entrepreneur specializing in low-level systems, automotive telematics, and modern C++ development.

For the past few years, I’ve been working on vehicle diagnostics and reverse engineering not only with OBD-II and UDS, but also with manufacturer-specific protocols and J1939. Earlier in my journey, I gained hands-on experience in Windows reverse engineering and built commercial game anti-cheat systems, which gave me a strong foundation in security and protection mechanisms.

I’m also an open-source enthusiast. I love experimenting and sharing ideas with the developer community. Outside of C++, I enjoy coding in TypeScript and Lua they’ve become some of my favorite playgrounds for rapid prototyping and side projects.

In addition, I actively contribute to security research, reporting vulnerabilities through platforms like HackerOne and Google VRP. Beyond development, I like creating tools and platforms that connect technology with real-world applications.

When I’m not in front of a screen, you’ll probably find me exploring the coastal life of world, planning road trips, or hacking together new ideas for fun.
