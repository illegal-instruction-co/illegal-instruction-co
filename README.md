## ILLEGAL INSTRUCTION CO
	The thing of consciousness is suffering. Consciousness has no meaning without suffering. we traded consciousness for everlasting happiness by eating the forbidden apple. I am happy with my consciousness, but the test of humanity is repentance to that forbidden apple. so this event will end when people want to be animals again. because they will admit that they are not as perfect as God, that they cannot carry consciousness. be cautious, try to be nice, but don't be upset that you can only watch what's going on.
