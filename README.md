I have a strong passion for reverse engineering and a deep interest in low-level programming. 
When I write code, I prioritize focusing on algorithms over syntax. 
I aim to create modular and easily extensible projects. 
My favorite programming languages are C++ and Lua, and I particularly enjoy game development and low-level programming. 
Interestingly, I struggle with math.

I'm a devoted Windows enthusiast, and most of my previous work has been centered around Windows. 
However, recently I've begun working on Linux using the WSL2 platform. 

Rather than specializing in a particular area, my focus is on continuous learning. 
I possess an insatiable curiosity for acquiring new knowledge within the field.

At present, I am actively engaged in projects involving embedded devices and the automotive sector.
