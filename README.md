I love reverse engineering and I'm a fan of low-level programming. 
When I write code, I prefer to focus on algorithms rather than syntax. 
I try to make my projects modular and easily extensible. 
My favorite programming languages are C++ and Lua, and my 
favorite areas are game development and low-level programming. Even i got really bad math :)

I'm a die-hard Windows fan and most of my previous work 
has been on Windows. However, recently I've started to work on Linux 
using the WSL2 platform. I'm not focused on any particular area, 
but rather on learning in general. I have an obsessive curiosity 
about learning new things and I'm constantly 
searching for new knowledge in the field.

Currently, i am working on embedded-devices and automotive sector.
