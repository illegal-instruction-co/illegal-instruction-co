illegal-instruction-co originally served as the honorary name of my personal company, 
where I conducted commercial activities. Now, it continues as an organization dedicated to 
open-source endeavors, preserving the same name out of respect for the past.

I am a software developer with a deep passion for reverse engineering and a strong interest 
in low-level programming. I also have a Bull Terrier, who is an important part of my life. 
When I write code, I prioritize focusing on algorithms rather than syntax. I aim to build modular
and extensible projects, and I thrive on solving complex problems through efficient code. 
My favorite programming languages are C++ and Lua, with a particular fondness for game development 
and low-level systems programming. Interestingly, I struggle with math but continue to improve through practical experience. Rather than specializing in a single area, my focus is on continuous learning.

As a committed Windows enthusiast, most of my prior work has been centered around Windows environments. 
Over the past few years, however, I have expanded my knowledge and have started working on Linux via the WSL2 platform.

Currently, I am involved in projects related to embedded systems and the automotive sector, particularly 
in the area of vehicle communication systems. Over the last 7 years, I've specialized in memory hacking and 
protection methods on Windows. For the past 2 years, I've also been working on my Ubuntu laptop, working on communication 
protocols such as OBDII, WWHOBD, UDS, and J1939 in the embedded systems domain.

Additionally, I have a 10-year background in web development, where I work with Laravel and ExpressJS for the backend, 
and React and Next.js for the frontend. This is a hobby that allows me to stay connected with the web development world 
and continuously improve my skills.
