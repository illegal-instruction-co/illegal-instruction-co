## Fun facts

- I firmly believe **semicolons improve personality.**  
- **My Bull Terrier** thinks he’s the real founder.  
- Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V — *the circle of life*.  
- My TODO list throws a stack overflow.  
- I once fixed a bug by deleting the feature.  
- 90% of my variables are named `temp`. The other 10% are named `temp2`.  
- Git is just a time machine where I always regret my past self.  
- I don’t write spaghetti code — I write lasagna code (layered, but still messy).  
- My exception handling strategy: `try {}` … *cry {}*  
- If you came here for serious stuff… you took a wrong turn on the internet.
